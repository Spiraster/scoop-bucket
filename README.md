My personal [bucket] for [Scoop].

This bucket contains [manifests] for applications that are absent from official buckets or have official implementations that I disagree with.

It can be added to Scoop by running:

    scoop bucket add spiraster https://github.com/Spiraster/scoop-bucket

[Scoop]: https://scoop.sh
